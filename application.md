## Prerequisites
COSMOS is targeted towards attendees from diverse fields (e.g., psychology, economics, neuroscience, biology, computer science, etc) and career stages (masters, PhD, postdoc, and junior PI). 

Participants should have a basic background knowledge in elementary statistics (e.g., probability theory) and programming in R in order to master the technical skills, but no prior experience with computational modeling is necessary.

## What we offer

Attendees will benefit from tutorials teaching the fundamentals of computational modeling in social and cultural settings, attend talks by leading researchers from around the world, and gain career advice during mentorship sessions. Returning in 2025 we will also have group projects, where participants can directly apply their new knowledge on a number of provided dataset under the supervision of our instructors.
