Dr Nakamaru is a professor at School of Environment and Society, Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan. Based on mathematical biology and evolutionary ecology, she has researched society from the viewpoint of the evolution of cooperation by means of evolutionary game theory and agent-based simulations. Now she is applying "the evolution of cooperation" studies to existing mutual aid systems, the abandonment problem of rice fields, supply chain network, and so on. She sometimes goes outsides to observe what the reality is, and does experimental and questionnaire works with collaborators to know how people make decisions. Then, she enjoys making new and general mathematical models following the observation and the result of the empirical works.
