Damien is a behavioural ecologist and computational biologist with a deep interest in the social behaviour of animals. His research combines running long-term monitoring projects on animal populations together with using high-resolution tracking of groups of individuals to gain a better understanding of how individuals contribute to their society and the consequences of doing so. He is an Associate Professor at the Australian National University.
