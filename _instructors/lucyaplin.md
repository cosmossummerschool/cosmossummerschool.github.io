Dr Lucy Aplin is an associate professor at the Research School of Biology at the Australian National University, and a SERI professorial fellow at the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Sciences at the University of Zurich. Her research aims to understand how innovations rise and spread through animal societies to form new cultural traits. Her research group - the cognitive ecology lab - studies these processes using a combination of captive and wild experiments with large-scale data collection, including with citizen science and automated tracking. This work has demonstrated how new behaviours can spread through social networks in birds to establish as multi-generational cultural traditions that are shaped by social dynamics such as turnover, and is revealing how cultural traits in animals can be source of behavioural plasticity in changing and modified environments.
