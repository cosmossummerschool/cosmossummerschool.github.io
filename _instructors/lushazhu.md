Lusha Zhu is a Professor at School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Peking University, China. Her research focuses primarily on the neural and cognitive processes of social decision-making, particularly, how the human brain anticipates actions and intentions of others with value-based goals to produce choices within interpersonal interactions.  Incorporating methods from decision neuroscience, game theory, cognitive psychology, and, sometimes, social network analysis and computational linguistics, her work seeks to develop mechanistic understanding about incentives, inferences, and strategies giving rise to complex social behaviors.
