Shinsuke Suzuki is a professor in the Faculty of Social Data Science at Hitotsubashi University. His research focuses on uncovering the neural and computational principles of human decision-making. He employs model-based fMRI, integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging with computational modeling. By identifying neural activity associated with specific computations, he aims to elucidate how the brain processes choices and to explore how these insights apply to mental disorders like gambling disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, and autism.
